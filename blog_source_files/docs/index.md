### Project Malm&ouml; Blog

Project Malm&ouml;, named after a town between Cambridge, UK where it was developed and Stockholm, Sweden where
Minecraft was created, is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that allows researchers to create challenging and
interesting tasks for evaluating agents, and Minecraft enthusiasts to engage in the Modding community and
help advance AI. The platform is built keeping in mind recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Video Game
playing; however, the project is intended to be very open ended allowing for research into more general AI topics
such as Multi-Agent systems, Transfer Learning, and Human-AI interaction.
